But it also highlights that pattern of superficial writing that you bring up here. The films are so vibrant, yet lack flavour - because all nuance is brushed aside and dimmed down. It makes it feel so... Uncanny. \r<br><br>With the Kiri scene, it is clearly intended to show that the humans fail to help her because they do not understand the spiritual aspects of Navi life. However, it has been established in this universe that the connection between the navi&#39;s and eywa isn&#39;t just spiritual - they&#39;re physical connections. You literally plug your nerve ends into the tree &#39;network&#39;. It is reinforced in both the first and second film: The apex of connection to Eywa is physical. That connection is also what causes Kiri&#39;s seizure. <br><br>Thematically, it then makes sense to have a schaman help her. But then we need to see this chaman doing something uniquely Navi - connecting to Kiri. Blowing air or chanting isn&#39;t what connects you to eywa, jamming your spinal chord into her is. \r<br>\r<br>Then imagine instead: the schamans healing ritual is completed by connecting herself to Kiri -  To sprititually and physically dig her out of that locked place she got stuck in during the seizure. We get emphasis on connection, on the blurred lines between spiritual and physical. <br><br>But... no. Blowing air it is. <br><br>Another similar issue is with the doctor (Norm). <br>He had great respect for eywa and the navi in previous films, yet here he is dryly stating &quot;Is seizure, it bad, no connect&quot;, completely disregarding the fact that eywa as a biological concept, is a belief that the team (led by Grace) shared, or at least respected. Jake himself got permanently transported into his Avatar body using that connection. Why is Norm suddenly all &quot;human science good, navi science bad&quot;, when it doesn&#39;t fit with his background?<br><br>So we have several instances here - in just one scene - of ignoring any nyance that was previously established, in favour of proving the point that the director wants.

Would you ??<br><br>And not every human is portrayed as evil like all of the scientist that remained on Pandora and some of the soldier who choose to do the same, the woman commander in the second movie says that earth is dying so now all of Pandora will become a human colony because they killed the earth.<br><br>And wow using the Aztec as your &quot;ancient human bad&quot; is probably the most moronic part of this video, the things they did as we know weren&#39;t good and sacrificing humans to their gods was their belief but does that mean the Spanish colonizer back in the day were correct in murdering them all ?? i thought killing was bad ??<br>And since we are here the Na&#39;vi believe in their own goddess Eywa, that aside her existence has been proven and speculated that it&#39;s the consciousness of the planet, she doesn&#39;t want any blood sacrifice in her name instead only wants the natural order to exist, so the humans have any right in killing the Na&#39;vi ?? the answer in a NO.<br><br>You seriously used the native Americans as point, that because they were having their own wars, their own issues with each other and their own atrocities, it was ok for the Brits and the Spaniards to kill them, steal their land and leave the few remaining struggler to suffer in modern times ?? <br>It&#39;s really disgusting using them like that to prove your point and seriously you can&#39;t even think that an ALIEN race won&#39;t act like us about slaves and torture, but what about the messed up shit that the &quot;modern&quot; human do ?? it&#39;s ok for us to be genocidal because we&#39;re advanced ?? one last thing, are we forgetting the witch trials ?? or the sub-human treatment of anyone who wasn&#39;t American white ?? or literally what every civilization have been doing to each other ?? even then it doesn&#39;t seem like a reason to wipe them out.<br><br>But let&#39;s go back to the Na&#39;vi, their connections with nature and the balance is for the very simple fact that they can physically and mentally connect with it, if the forest (or any piece of land where they live) is sick or damaged it will effect them.<br><br><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RGx8rYbRVR4&amp;t=908\">15:08</a> You mean like the argument that Earth is dying so they must colonize another planet so can humanity can survive, instead of not killing their own planet ?? or that a precious and new metal can only be found on a singular planet, so the &quot;must&quot; take it for themself for who knows what advancement ?? <br><br>For Kiri&#39;s seizure it&#39;s an undeniable fact that modern medicine is way better BUT at the same time the human race as been using medicinal plants, parts of animals and all other thing to heal ever since we discovered them, implying that old medical achievements will somehow be always useless is just plain wrong, oh and also Na&#39;vi aren&#39;t humans you can&#39;t put the same biological standards on them and since the first movie they talk about the over abundant energy that flows on Pandora, Ronal (the Na&#39;vi woman who helped Kiri) says how she had to much of this energy and so she performed a NA&#39;VI HEALING METHOD, i don&#39;t understand how can human medicine work on a Na&#39;vi better than their own medicines<br>Also... what is the story is saying ?? that their own understanding of their body and how they work is better than a human ?? wow what an abstract thought, do you understand how their head braid works ??
